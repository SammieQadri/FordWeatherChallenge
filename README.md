# FordWeatherApp

This project is intended to use the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather in 4 major US Cities.
The chosen cities are Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, and New York.

Furthermore, upon clicking on the city, you will be able to open a modal that will display the ten day forecast for that city as well. 

There is also navigation to the about and contact us page. 

In order to run this project, you will need to run `npm install` in this directory prior to running the development server. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.
